			</p>
            <p style = "text-align: center">I'm an Associate Mainframe Developer with practical experience supporting and enhancing enterprise-level applications in a contract-to-hire role. My work has involved maintaining and developing solutions in COBOL and JCL, with a strong focus on legacy systems that are central to business operations. I have hands-on experience working with IDMS for database access and manipulation, developing and debugging Easytrieve reports, and using Endevor for version control and code promotion within a structured SDLC.
                                            Throughout this role, I've gained a deep appreciation for the reliability and complexity of mainframe environments. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and ensuring smooth operations across batch cycles and production support tasks. I'm now seeking to continue my growth in a full-time role at American Greetings, where I can contribute my technical skills, adaptability, and collaborative mindset to help drive long-term system stability and innovation.
